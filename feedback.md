Hello Hyunji
I really like your innovative approach when developing your assigned pages.
Though I know this is not your coding style as you have worked on this with a tutor, I do hope that you have learned a lot during the process.
Anyways, I have marked some issues on some of your code in which I want you to keep in mind of in the future. 
I will brief you on your next task through D2L very shortly
